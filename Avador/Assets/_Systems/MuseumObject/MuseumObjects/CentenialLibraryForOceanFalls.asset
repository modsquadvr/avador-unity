  ObjectName: Centenial Library for Ocean Falls
  Description: "\rDate:\r\n    1958\r\nRecord:\r\n    J-00876 (GR-3280)\r\n\r\nThis
    1958 photograph shows the people of Ocean Falls joining in the province\u2019s
    celebrations by coming together to launch a new community library, turning the
    first sod on June 5th. It was a centennial project, marking 100 years since the
    founding of the mainland Colony of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nRemote places like
    Ocean Falls are a part of a community family that links to the provincial family
    through records like this one. As men, women and children came together to take
    the first steps toward their new library, the Ocean Falls community showed their
    involvement in the province\u2019s celebrations. Since libraries are egalitarian,
    family-oriented spaces in communities, I think this photograph represents one
    of the positive aspects of the wider \u201Cfamily\u201D.\r\n\r\nSeries GR-3280
    consists of records acquired by the British Columbia Centennial Committee showcasing
    projects, celebrations and participants from the province\u2019s 1958, 1966-67
    and 1971 centennials. The committee received more than 7,000 photographs from
    around the province. Photographs in this Ocean Falls file were sent to the centennial
    committee by Mr. D. Heibert of Ocean Falls.\r"
