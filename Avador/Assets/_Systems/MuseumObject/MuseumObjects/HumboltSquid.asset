  Description: "\rDate:\r\n    collected in 2004\r\nRecord:\r\n    004-00050-001\r\nScientific
    Name:\r\n    Dosidicus gigas\r\nCommon Name:\r\n    Jumbo squid, Humboldt squid,
    Diablo Rojo\r\n\r\nTypically, these large squid (also commonly known as Jumbo
    Squid, or Diablo Rojo in Spanish) are distributed farther south in deep offshore
    waters ranging from Chile to Mexico. However within the last decade, Humboldt
    Squid, Dosidicus gigas have appeared sporadically off the coast of British Columbia.
    While several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this shift, including
    changes in ocean temperature and overfishing of would-be-competitors, the ultimate
    factors driving these northward invasions remain unclear.\r\n\r\nHumboldt Squid
    are aggressive predators, feeding on other invertebrates and fishes, and at times,
    even cannibalistic on each other. They often flash bright red when hunting (hence
    the Spanish name, which translates into \u2018Red Devil\u2019). Typically they
    move up and down the water column following their prey. However on occasion,
    large numbers move into shallow waters, perhaps in pursuit of herring or sardines,
    and become stranded inadvertently as the tide recedes (as was documented on Tofino
    beaches in 2009).\r\n\r\nThis individual was one of the first specimens collected
    in 2004 off the West Coast of Vancouver Island.\r"
