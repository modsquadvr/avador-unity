    Doll in Canadian Women\u2019s Army Corps service dress\r\n\r\nDuring the war,
    while many women served on the home front, others went to war. The first women\u2019s
    unit raised was the Canadian Women\u2019s Army Corps (CWAC), founded in Victoria
    in 1941 by Mrs. Joan Kennedy. Although they were first dismissed as a \u201Cpetticoat
    army\u201D by a patronizing male, they became regular army in 1942. The CWAC
    uniforms included buttons featuring the image of Athena, Goddess of War. One
    who wore that uniform was Mary Greyeyes Reid, the first indigenous woman to join
    the CWAC. After the war she moved to Victoria and worked in a local restaurant
    until she retired. After her death in 2011 she was buried at Muskeg Lake Cree
    Nation, Saskatchewan. More than 22,000 women served in the CWAC.\r\n\r\nDenied
    combat roles, CWAC women provided clerical, transport and wireless support, including
    deployment overseas in England, Italy and Northern Germany. Some did secret decoding
    and cipher work. Initially disbanded in August 1946, they were reinstituted and
    continued to serve until 1964.\r\n\r\nThe 17,038 women of the Royal Canadian
    Air Force Women\u2019s Division (WD) did essential work, releasing men for overseas
    service and playing a crucial role at the training air bases of the British Commonwealth
    Air Training Program in Canada, where they prepared Allied air crews for combat.
    Their work expanded quickly to include over 22 trades, mechanical, electrical,
    radio, and parachute packing. Others served with RCAF Overseas Headquarters in
    London, sharing the risk of enemy bombing.\r\n\r\nThe last women\u2019s unit
    founded were the 6,000 women of the Women\u2019s Royal Canadian Naval Service
    (WRCNS), nicknamed \u201CWrens\u201D, who were excluded from warships until 1945.
    But naval land bases being technically \u201Cstone frigates,\u201D means the
    base commander at HMCS Bytown II, Captain Isabel Mcneill, became the first woman
    to command a RCN \u201Cship.\u201D Only paid 2/3 a male wage, the Wrens handled
    a wide range of clerical and transport work but also did LORAN, signals and cipher
    work. One hundred WRCNS participated in headquarters command and control work
    during D-Day.\r\n\r\nAs in the previous war, women also served overseas in the
    Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps (RCAMC) Nursing Sisters, holding a junior officer
    rank to give them authority over patients. They also shared the risks of bombing
    and shelling. Canadian women also worked for the Canadian Red Cross Service,
    providing comforts for wounded personnel, victims of war and prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nAfter
    VE Day and demobilization, women war veterans joined the multi-service Canadian
    Legion, which has its own uniform. The service dress dolls pictured here are
    a gift of the Ex-Service Women\u2019s Royal Canadian Legion Branch 182. The Branch
    was founded in 1945 and disbanded in 2008. The dolls were displayed at public
    events and monthly meetings as a remembrance of past war service. The CWAC uniform
    was made by Dorothy Creasy (Ferguson) from an old uniform and shirttail. The
    WD doll service uniform was crafted by Ione Canning (Ellis) with the hat badge,
    buttons and belt buckle insignia by Delphine Large (Cameron). The WRCNS uniform
    was made by Ethel Jaggard. The RCMC nursing sister was made by Sergeant Dorothy
    Creasy.\r\n"
