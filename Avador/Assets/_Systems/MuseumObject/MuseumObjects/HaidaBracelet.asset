  Description: "\rDate:\r\n    1980\r\nRecord:\r\n    RBCM 18826\r\nMaterials:\r\n   
    silver\r\nArtist:\r\n    Robert Davidson\r\n\r\nguud san glans, Robert Davidson
    (born 1946) is a great grandson of the Haida artist, Charles Edenshaw, and carries
    on Edenshaw\u2019s legacy of innovation combined with traditional craftsmanship.
    This beautifully designed and executed silver bracelet, titled Happy Negative
    Spaces, was made in 1980 and is one of his most important early abstract works.
    Davidson went on to further explore the abstract possibilities of Haida form
    in printmaking, painting and sculpture. The Seattle Art Museum\u2019s 2013 exhibition,
    Robert Davidson: Abstract Impulse, brought together much of this important innovative
    work. The exhibition, which included this bracelet, travelled to the National
    Museum of the American Indian in New York City.\r\r"
