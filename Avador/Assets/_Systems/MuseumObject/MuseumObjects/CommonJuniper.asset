  Description: "\rDate:\r\n    collected in 1970\r\nRecord:\r\n    V086311\r\nScientific
    Name:\r\n    Juniperus communis L.\r\n\r\nSome BC First Nations burned juniper
    boughs to fumigate a house, or made a preparation from the cones to kill ticks
    on horses.\r\n\r\nThis specimen of Common Juniper, Juniperus communis L. demonstrates
    that having the breadth and depth of large natural history collections such as
    ours requires the expertise and generosity of many community members in the province.
    It was collected in Haida Gwaii in 1970 by ethnobotanist Nancy Turner, who donated
    her plant collections to the RBCM herbarium.\r\n\r\nMany of our herbarium specimens
    are donated by private individuals, environmental consultants, and students and
    staff from colleges and universities.\r"
