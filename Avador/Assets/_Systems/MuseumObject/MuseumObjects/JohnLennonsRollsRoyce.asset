  ObjectName: John Lennon's Rolls Royce
  Description: "\rDate:\r\n    painted in 1967\r\nRecord:\r\n    992.66.2\r\nArtist:\r\n   
    Stephen Weaver\r\n\r\nThis Rolls Royce Phantom V Touring Limousine, delivered
    in 1965 to John Lennon, has been identified as the car that took the Beatles
    to Buckingham Palace to receive their MBEs. When Lennon ordered it, he did not
    yet have a driver\u2019s licence.\r\n\r\nIt is the largest model made by the
    celebrated English car-manufacturing company, and had several custom updates
    over the next two years, including modifying the rear seat to convert to a double
    bed. In 1967 \u2013 the year the Beatles released Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Heart\u2019s
    Club Band \u2013 Lennon commissioned artist Stephen Weaver to create a design
    for the unique custom paint job that replaced the original matte black finish.\r\n\r\nIn
    1970, John Lennon and Yoko Ono had the Rolls shipped to the US, and in 1977,
    they donated it to a New York City museum.\r\n\r\nThe car was donated to the
    province in 1992 by BC entrepreneur and philanthropist Jim Pattison, OC, OBC.
    He was Chairman of Expo 86, which had the theme of Transportation. He had acquired
    the car at auction, where it briefly established the highest price ever paid
    for an automobile.\r\n\r\nIt has been enjoyed here in Victoria, and loaned to
    other museums around the world.\r"
